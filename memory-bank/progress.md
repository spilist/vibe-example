## Known Issues & Challenges

### üö® Current Blockers
**None** - Ready to proceed with development

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Challenges Identified

1. **Tailwind CSS v4 Configuration**
   - **Issue:** v4 is relatively new, setup process may differ
   - **Mitigation:** Verify documentation and fallback to v3 if needed
   - **Priority:** Medium

2. **Gemini API Rate Limits**
   - **Issue:** Potential rate limiting during development/testing
   - **Mitigation:** Implement proper error handling and retry logic
   - **Priority:** Medium

3. **Metascraper Reliability**
   - **Issue:** Different websites may have varying metadata quality
   - **Mitigation:** Implement fallback strategies and validation
   - **Priority:** Low

4. **Authentication Edge Cases**
   - **Issue:** Session management across route changes
   - **Mitigation:** Thorough testing of auth flows
   - **Priority:** Medium

## Success Metrics Tracking

### Development Metrics
- **Code Quality:** TypeScript strict mode, ESLint compliance
- **Performance:** Core Web Vitals monitoring
- **Security:** All routes properly protected, environment variables secured
- **Functionality:** All user flows working end-to-end

### Business Metrics (Post-MVP)
- **Usage:** 50+ resources categorized in first week
- **Efficiency:** <15 seconds to find any resource
- **Process Speed:** <2 minutes from URL to approved resource

## Technical Debt Tracking

### Current Technical Debt
**None** - Fresh project start

### Potential Future Debt Areas
- **Error Handling:** May need refinement based on real-world usage
- **Performance:** Image loading and caching optimization
- **Code Organization:** Component structure may need refactoring as features grow
- **Testing Coverage:** Comprehensive test suite will be needed

## Evolution Notes

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **App Router over Pages Router** - Better performance and DX
2. **Supabase over Custom Backend** - Faster development, built-in features
3. **Server Components First** - Better performance, SEO benefits
4. **Manual Review Process** - Quality control over automation

### Requirements Evolution
- **Started:** PRD-defined MVP requirements
- **Current:** No changes from original specification
- **Future:** May need bulk processing, public features (per PRD roadmap)

## Next Session Preparation

### Ready for Implementation
- All planning documentation complete
- Technical architecture clearly defined
- Component hierarchy established
- Database schema specified
- Development workflow outlined

### Immediate Next Steps
1. Install and configure all dependencies
2. Set up Supabase project with schema
3. Create basic app structure with layouts
4. Implement authentication flow

### Success Criteria for Next Session
- Working Next.js app with Tailwind styling
- Supabase connection established
- Basic authentication working
- Admin layout with route protection
- Ready to implement core features
