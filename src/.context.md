# Source Directory Rules

This directory contains the source code for the Next.js application.

## File Organization

- **app/**: Contains Next.js App Router files (pages, layouts, components)
- **components/**: Reusable React components (when created)
- **lib/**: Utility functions and shared logic (when created)
- **types/**: TypeScript type definitions (when created)
- **hooks/**: Custom React hooks (when created)
- **styles/**: Additional CSS/styling files (when created)

## Naming Conventions

- Use PascalCase for React components: `MyComponent.tsx`
- Use camelCase for utility functions and variables
- Use kebab-case for directories when they contain multiple words
- Prefix custom hooks with `use`: `useCustomHook.ts`

## Code Structure

- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks or utility functions
- Use TypeScript for all new files
- Export components using default exports for pages/layouts, named exports for utilities

## Import Organization

```typescript
// 1. React and Next.js imports
import React from 'react'
import { NextPage } from 'next'

// 2. Third-party library imports
import clsx from 'clsx'

// 3. Internal imports (absolute paths preferred)
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
import { useAuth } from '@/hooks/useAuth'

// 4. Relative imports
import './component.css'
```

## Performance Considerations

- Use dynamic imports for code splitting when appropriate
- Implement proper image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Consider Server Components vs Client Components appropriately
- Use React.memo() for expensive components when needed

## Error Handling

- Implement proper error boundaries
- Use try-catch blocks for async operations
- Provide meaningful error messages for users
- Log errors appropriately for debugging

## Accessibility

- Include proper ARIA labels and roles
- Ensure keyboard navigation works
- Provide alternative text for images
- Maintain proper color contrast ratios
