# Library Directory Rules

This directory contains utility functions, configuration, and shared logic for the Vibe Coding Resource Directory application.

## File Organization

- **constants.ts**: Application-wide constants (API endpoints, UI config, validation rules, messages)
- **utils.ts**: Pure utility functions (validation, formatting, type guards, async helpers)
- **supabase.ts**: Supabase client configuration and database utilities (to be created)
- **gemini.ts**: Google Gemini API client and prompt templates (to be created)

## Code Standards

### Utility Functions
- Keep functions pure and side-effect free when possible
- Use descriptive function names that explain the purpose
- Include JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Use TypeScript type guards for validation functions
- Export functions as named exports

### Constants
- Group related constants in objects with `as const`
- Use UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for constant names
- Provide descriptive comments for non-obvious values
- Keep magic numbers here instead of scattered throughout code

### Error Handling
- Use the `safeAsync` utility for promise-based operations
- Provide meaningful error messages in constants
- Log errors appropriately but don't expose sensitive information

## Import Patterns

```typescript
// Import specific utilities
import { isValidUrl, truncateText } from '@/lib/utils'
import { API_ENDPOINTS, ERROR_MESSAGES } from '@/lib/constants'

// Use constants instead of magic numbers/strings
const response = await fetch(API_ENDPOINTS.ANALYZE)
```

## Testing Considerations

- Utility functions should be easily testable
- Avoid dependencies on external services in pure utilities
- Mock external API calls in tests
- Test edge cases and error conditions
